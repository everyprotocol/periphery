# Every Protocol Periphery

Every Protocol enables intuitive, collaborative, secure, and rewarding onchain co-creation.

Every Protocol introduces the Object Token (or simply, object) â€” a next-gen token with structure, semantics, and interoperability. Each object has a kind, is minted from a set, and is composed of elements. Objects can interact with one another through relations defined at the kind level. Every aspect of an object can be created or developed by anyone, unlocking true onchain collaboration.

This repository hosts periphery contracts of the Every Protocol.
